// Adds an extra triangle for each occluder to compensate for situations where a light might be
// very close to an occluder. Normally, this would cause light to bleed through the wall. Setting
// this macro to `true` will solve near-light problems but does incur a slight performance penalty.

// Whether renderers, lights, and sunlight should default to having normal map support enabled.
// This saves a lot of time setting `.normalMap` on everything that you create. Enabling normal
// maps has a significant performance penalty so use this carefully.

// The alpha threshold for sprites when drawing to the normal map. Anything below this value will
// be discarded by the shader.
#macro BULB_NORMAL_MAP_ALPHA_THRESHOLD  0.5

// The default notional "z height" for lights and sunlight. This z value is only used when
// calculating normal map influence on lights. A lower value brings the light closer to the plane,
// leading to a shallower angle of attack. This leads to more intense normal maps where the edges
// of shapes will be highlighted more strongly than the tops of shapes, especially at distance.
